# Teaching-HEIGVD-AMT-2018-Project

##Introduction

Welcome to our project !

We are currently building an gamification engine. The project is still on his way but we are proud to show you what you can already do.

This project contains an web application where you can register and log in as a developer and add/edit/delete some applications. The web application will give you an API Key and an API Secret.

It is possible to manage the website if you log in as an admin. The admins have the possibility to supsend users, reset their password or look at the logs of the web application.

The project is working with an Payara application server wich is supplied by an MySQL database wich is maintained by PHPMyAdmin. You will find another project folder wich is an tester for our project. There is also several ".m" files to make you know more about the work done.
